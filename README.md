2025 OSCP checklists for an easy pass

Paste into obsidian for easy use.

Table of contents:
- AD checklist
- Windows privesc checklist
- Linux privesc checklist
- Solve sheet for standalones
- Status sheet for AD

How to use these files?
- the checklists are pretty self explanatory
- solve and status sheets serve as a baseline for info that needs to be gathered about a target

Dislaimer:
These are not exhaustive in any way. These resources are simply what allowed me to pass the exam.
